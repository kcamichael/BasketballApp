# BasketballApp

This app aims to track players, coaches and the schools they play and coach at. It adds to a local database with a data table for
positions that doesn't appear in the view model along with tables for the colleges, coaches and players. It can add to and update 
the tables as well as delete them and show more information about the college, coach and players.

In the transfer portal era this app will keep you up to date with all the changes. From players going between colleges to colleges
switching conferences. The app doesn't limit you to power 5 schools but lets you put whichever college you want from whichever conference.
Add women's and men's teams and their coaches here with plenty of descriptors to keep you up with everything happening.
